		<h3>Sept. 2018</h3>

		<p>Jacqueline Hackett (born January 14, 1999) is a singer-songwriter based in New York City with a folk/rock influence.

She frequently plays shows in both NYC + Nashville and is excited to finally release her original music very soon. </p>

		<p>Other passions include political activism (with an emphasis on gun control and LGBTQ+ rights), attempting to cook meals for her girlfriend, hiking, traveling, The Bachelor and filmmaking- a new found love.
